    /**
     * Returns a key that determines whether or not two items can be merged together.
     * If the keys match, the system will merge the items.
     *
     * Uses the CartService.automaticallyMergeLikeItems to determine if the key should
     * include non-promotion related merging.
     *
     * This process complements the merging and splitting required for the system.  To fully
     * understand this flag, you need to understand the reason that the system splits items.
     *
     * In the cart, an item can only have one price.   Consider the example, where you have a cart-item with a quantity
     * of two and a buy-one get one free promotion.   After the promotion is applied, you would have two
     * items in the cart: one at the regular price, and one free.
     *
     * Now, assume the promotion is removed.   The system will automatically merge the two items
     * back together.
     *
     * This method generates an "identifier" (or key) that determines whether two items can
     * be merged.   The expected behavior allows users to amend the merging requirements for
     * promotions and choose to always merge like items by setting the CartService.automaticallyMergeLikeItems
     * to true.
     *
     * If merging is too aggressive for your implementation, you might choose to override this
     * method to add more specific rules for merging like items.    The key is that the system
     * will merge items that return the same String identifier.
     *
     * The out of box implementation insures the following:
     * - Items in a bundle do not get merged outside of the bundle
     * - Items do not get merged with items in a separate fulfillment group
     * - If the CartService.automaticallyMergeLikeItems is false, only items that were
     *   previously split by the promotion engine will be merged; otherwise, the system
     *   will try to merge all like items.

     * @param extraIdentifier
