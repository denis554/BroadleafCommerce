/**
 * This is the main entity used to hold fulfillment information about an Order. An Order can have
 * multiple FulfillmentGroups to support shipping items to multiple addresses along with fulfilling
 * items multiple ways (ship some overnight, deliver some with digital download). This constraint means
 * that a FulfillmentGroup is unique based on an Address and FulfillmentOption combination. This
 * also means that in the common case for Orders that are being delivered to a single Address and
 * a single way (shipping everything express; ie a single FulfillmentOption) then there will be
 * only 1 FulfillmentGroup for that Order.
