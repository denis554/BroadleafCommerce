/**
 * A product option represents a value that is entered to specify more information about
 * a product prior to entering into the cart.
 *
 * For example, a product of type shirt might have product options of "size" and "color".
 *
 * There is an inherent relationship between product options and product SKUs.  A sku is
 * meant to provide a way to override the pricing of a product for a specific set of options.
 * Inventory can also be tracked at the SKU level.
 *
 * For example, consider a shirt that is sold in 5 colors and 5 sizes.   For this example,
 * there would be 1 product.   It would have 10 options (5 colors + 5 sizes).   The product would
 * have as few as 1 SKu and a many as 26 SKUs.
 *
 * 1 SKU would indicate that the system is not tracking inventory for the items and that all of the
 * variations of shirt are priced the same way.
 *
 * 26 would indicate that there are 25 SKUs that are used to track inventory and potentially
 * override pricing.    The extra "1" sku is used to hold the default pricing.
