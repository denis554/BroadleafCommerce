/**
 * A Thymeleaf processor that will include the standard head element. It will also set the

 * 
 * <ul>
 *  <li><b>pageTitle</b> - The title of the page</li>
 *  <li><b>additionalCss</b> - An additional, page specific CSS file to include</li>
 *  <li><b>metaDescription</b> - Optional, Content for the Meta-Description tag</li>
 *  <li><b>metaKeywords</b> - Optional, Content for the Meta-Keywords tag</li>
 *  <li><b>metaRobot</b> - Optional, Content for the Meta-Robots tag</li>

 *
 * The entire FragmentAndTarget class has been deprecated in favor of a completely new system in Thymeleaf 2.1
 * The referenced issue can be found at https://github.com/thymeleaf/thymeleaf/issues/205
 *
 * Use th:include or th:replace within the head tag and include the variables to replicate the behaviour.
 *
 * Examples:
 *
 * <head th:include="/layout/partials/head (pageTitle='My Page Title')"></head>
 * <head th:include="/layout/partials/head (twovar=${value2},onevar=${value1})">...</head>
