/**
 * Adorned target collections are a variant of the basic collection type (@see AdminPresentationCollection).
 * This type of collection concept comes into play when you want to represent a "ToMany" association, but
 * you also want to capture some additional data around the association. CrossSaleProductImpl is an example of
 * this concept. CrossSaleProductImpl not only contains a product reference, but sequence and
 * promotional message fields as well. We want the admin user to choose the desired product for the association
 * and also specify the order and promotional message information to complete the interaction.
 * The Adorned target concept embodied in this annotation makes this possible.
