/**
 * <p>
 * A holder for common.properties location. This assumes that this is from the current classpath as this drives
 * the creation of a {@link ClassPathResource}. Example:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * {@literal @}Configuration
 * public class ModuleProperties {
 *     {@literal @}Bean
 *     public static FrameworkCommonPropertySource blModuleProps() {
 *         return new FrameworkCommonPropertySource("config/bc/module");
 *     }
 * }
 * 
 * <p>
 * This is used to derive special meaning in the {@link ProfileAwarePropertiesBeanFactoryPostProcessor} where they are
 * added to the active Spring {@link Environment}.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Any properties resolved by these classes have a lower precedence than any {@link ProfileAwarePropertySource}.
 * 
 * <p>
 * These bean instances are created very early in the Spring lifecycle, during {@link BeanFactoryPostProcessor} instantiation. Therefore
 * you should not be doing any complicated bean logic here (instantating dependencies, trying to {@literal @}Autowire anything, etc) or
 * else you might run into unintended consequences. Also note that the registration of this {@literal @}Bean method is {@code static} since
 * it should follow the same registration rules of a {@link BeanFactoryPostProcessor}.
