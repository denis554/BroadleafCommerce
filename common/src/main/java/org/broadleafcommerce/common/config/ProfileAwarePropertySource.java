/**
 * <p>
 * Holder for a folder of properties resources comprised of something like the following on the classpath:
 * 
 * <ul>
 *   <li>classpath:/runtime-properties/</li>
 *   <ul>
 *     <li>common.properties</li>
 *     <li>common-shared.properties</li>
 *     <li>[profile].properties</li>
 *     <li>[profile]-shared.properties</li>
 *   </ul>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Where the [environment] is a key that is resolved from the current Spring profile. Given that set of properties, they get ordered in the following way:
 * 
 * <ul>
 *   <li>classpath:/runtime-properties/</li>
 *   <ol>
 *     <li>common-shared.properties</li>
 *     <li>common.properties</li>
 *     <li>[profile]-shared.properties</li>
 *     <li>[profile].properties</li>
 *   </ol>
 * </ul>
 *  
 * <p>
 * If you are using Spring boot, this is a deprecated construct and instead you should rely on application.properties.
 * and the ordering given in the 
 * 
 * <p>
 * Properties registered via this {@link ProfileAwarePropertySource} is functionally equivalent to registering them via {@link PropertySource} and have the same ordering
 * semantics as
 * <a href="http://docs.spring.io/autorepo/docs/spring-boot/current/reference/html/boot-features-external-config.html#boot-features-external-config">"{@literal @}PropertySource annotations on your {@literal @}Configuration classes</a>.
 * The exception is that these are also guaranteed to take a higher precedence than {@link FrameworkCommonPropertySource}.
 * 
 * <p>
 * There is generally only a single one of these beans registered in the application. If multiple of them are registered, they are ordered based on
 * {@link #getOrder()} and <i>all</i> properties are added to the {@link Environment} prior to moving to the next {@link ProfileAwarePropertySource}.
 * 
 * <p>
 * These are guaranteed to take a higher precedence (and thus override) properties registered via {@link FrameworkCommonPropertySource}
 * 
 * <p>
 * These bean instances are created very early in the Spring lifecycle, during {@link BeanFactoryPostProcessor} instantiation. Therefore
 * you should not be doing any complicated bean logic here (instantating dependencies, trying to {@literal @}Autowire anything, etc) or
 * else you might run into unintended consequences.
