/**
 * <p>
 * Bootstraps the Broadleaf <b>root</b> admin configuration XML for only non-servlet beans. This can be placed on any {@literal @}Configuration
 * class (except ones with additional {@literal @}ImportResource) to make the root Broadleaf beans apart of the {@link ApplicationContext}
 * 
 * <p>
 * Since this annotation is a meta-annotation for {@literal @}ImportResource, this <b>cannot</b> be placed on a {@literal @}Configuration class
 * that contains an {@literal @}ImportResource annotation.
 *  
 * <p>
 * Since this does not include any of the servlet-specific Broadleaf beans, this is generally only used when you are not running in a 
 * servlet environment at all or there is a parent-child relationship between a root {@link ApplicationContext} and you want to
 * configure multiple servlets that share much of the same beans. In general, rather than create multiple servlets with shared
 * configuration you should instead create separate deployments and utilize {@link EnableBroadleafAdminAutoConfiguration} in a single place.
 * 
 * <p>
 * This import utilizes the {@link FrameworkXmlBeanDefinitionReader} so that framework XML bean definitions will not
 * overwrite beans defined in a project.
