/**
 * Base Integration Test Setup groovy file for Site based integration tests. This base class has all the
 * applicationContext's shared by Integration tests for Site based testing. Extend from this class on a
 * per project basis with another setup file that contains only an @ContextHeirarchy(@ContextConfiguration)
 * that references this "siteContexts" ContextConfiguration and add only the contexts, in the locations
 * parameter, that you need to run your tests at that level. Then extend off of that setup file with your
 * actual integration tests. IntegrationSetup files should not have any code in their body's.
